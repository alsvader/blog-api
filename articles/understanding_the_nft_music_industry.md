Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are generally seen as pictures or videos.

That is a misconception that we will uncover in this article by exploring the NFT music industry.

We will explore why people support music artists by purchasing their NFTs with cryptocurrencies.

## What is an NFT, and what does NFT stand for?

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token.

An NFT is a digital file that lives on the blockchain. Once it is on the blockchain, it can not be removed.

The idea of an NFT existing on the blockchain means that it can not be changed, and it is easy to identify the current and previous owners of an NFT.

An easy way to understand NFTs is to compare them to a fungible token.

A fungible token is a token that retains the same value compared to another token that originates from the same contract.

## Why are musicians getting involved with NFTs?

Digital music has been a rising trend since it was released. The use of CDs has declined dramatically, especially after the release of music streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music.

Musicians now stream most of their music on these services. However, music artists are unfairly paid. The revenue percentage from music streaming has been an issue for years, with artists getting paid around 15% per stream.üòî
